# Data Modelling with Postgres

## Introduction
This repo contains files required to run an ETL process in order to create a database in Postgres. They are part of one of the projects required in Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree, called Data Modelling with Postgres.

## Context
In this project, as the Data Engineer of a fictional music startup called Sparkify, I had to create a database in Postgres using .json files containing song and songplays data in order to provide tables in which the analytics team can perform some queries to understand better users' behaviour. In this process, I created the tables' schemas and wrote the scripts in Python used for the ETL pipeline, using best practices in terms of documentation, data quality checks and code writing.
